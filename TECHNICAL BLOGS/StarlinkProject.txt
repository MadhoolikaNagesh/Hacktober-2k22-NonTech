Starlink is a satellite internet service operated by SpaceX, the company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk.

Starlink primarily focuses on delivering high-speed, low-latency broadband internet in remote and rural locations globally.
In the US, Starlink's median download speed in the second quarter of 2022 hit just over 62 Mbps, according to the network intelligence firm Ookla.
That's more than sufficient for one or two people to stream videos, download games or do whatever they want on the internet.

From a consumer perspective, Starlink works with the help of a Starlink kit -- that includes a Starlink satellite dish, WiFi router/power supply, cables and base.
The Starlink base is designed for ground level installation, or to support a quick-start setup to test your internet connection

Meanwhile, SpaceX hsa partnered with T-Mobile to put an end to mobile dead zones. Using its existing midband spectrum,
T-Mobile plans to enable cell phones to connect to Starlink satellites, bringing coverage to remote areas with no existing cell service.
